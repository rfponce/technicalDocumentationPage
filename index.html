                <h2>What is CSS?</h2>

                <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under
                    the hood? This article explains what CSS is, with a simple syntax example, and also covers some key
                    terms about the language.</p>
                <br />

            <section class="theme-section" id="What_is_CSS_for?">
                <h2>What is CSS for?</h2>

                <p>As we have mentioned before, CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users —
                    how they are styled, laid out, etc.</p>

                <p>A document is usually a text file structured using a markup language — HTML is the most common markup
                    language, but you may also come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML.</p>

                <p>Presenting a document to a user means converting it into a form usable by your audience. Browsers,
                    like Firefox, Chrome, or Edge , are designed to present documents visually, for example, on a
                    computer screen, projector or printer.</p>

                <div class="note">
                    <p><span class="note__header">Note:</span> A browser is sometimes called a user agent, which basically means a computer
                        program that represents a person inside a computer system. Browsers are the main type of user
                        agent we think of when talking about CSS, however, it is not the only one. There are other user
                        agents available — such as those which convert HTML and CSS documents into PDFs to be printed.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example changing the color and size of
                    headings and links. It can be used to create layout — for example turning a single column of text
                    into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be used
                    for effects such as animation. Have a look at the links in this paragraph for specific examples.</p>
                <br />
                <p><a href="#home">Go to Home</a></p>

            <section class="theme-section" id="CSS_syntax">
                <h2>CSS syntax</h2>

                <p>CSS is a rule-based language — you define rules specifying groups of styles that should be applied to
                    particular elements or groups of elements on your web page. For example "I want the main heading on
                    my page to be shown as large red text."</p>

                <p>The following code shows a very simple CSS rule that would achieve the styling described above:</p>

                <div class="code-container">
                    <code>
                        h1 {<br>
                        color: red;<br>
                        font-size: 5em;<br>
                        }
                    </code>
                </div>

                <p>The rule opens with a selector . This selects the HTML element that we are going to style. In this
                    case we are styling level one headings (&lt;h1&gt;).</p>

                <p>We then have a set of curly braces { }. Inside those will be one or more declarations, which take the
                    form of property and value pairs. Each pair specifies a property of the element(s) we are selecting,
                    then a value that we'd like to give the property.</p>

                <p>Before the colon, we have the property, and after the colon, the value. CSS properties have different
                    allowable values, depending on which property is being specified. In our example, we have the color
                    property, which can take various color values. We also have the font-size property. This property
                    can take various size units as a value.</p>

                <p>A CSS stylesheet will contain many such rules, written one after the other.</p>

                <div class="code-container">
                    <code>
                        h1 {<br>
                        color: red;<br>
                        font-size: 5em;<br>
                        }<br>
                        <br>
                        p {<br>
                        color: black;<br>
                        }
                    </code>
                </div>

                <p>You will find that you quickly learn some values, whereas others you will need to look up. The
                    individual property pages on MDN give you a quick way to look up properties and their values when
                    you forget, or want to know what else you can use as a value.</p>

                <div class="note">
                    <p><span class="note__header">Note:</span> You can find links to all the CSS property pages (along with other CSS
                        features) listed on the MDN CSS reference. Alternatively, you should get used to searching for
                        "mdn css-feature-name" in your favorite search engine whenever you need to find out more
                        information about a CSS feature. For example, try searching for "mdn color" and "mdn font-size"!
                    </p>

                <br />

            <section class="theme-section" id="CSS_Modules">
                <h2>CSS Modules</h2>

                <p>As there are so many things that you could style using CSS, the language is broken down into modules.
                    You'll see reference to these modules as you explore MDN and many of the documentation pages are
                    organized around a particular module. For example, you could take a look at the MDN reference to the
                    Backgrounds and Borders module to find out what its purpose is, and what different properties and
                    other features it contains. You will also find links to the CSS Specification that defines the
                    technology (see below).</p>

                <p>At this stage you don't need to worry too much about how CSS is structured, however it can make it
                    easier to find information if, for example, you are aware that a certain property is likely to be
                    found among other similar things and are therefore probably in the same specification.</p>

                <p>For a specific example, let's go back to the Backgrounds and Borders module — you might think that it
                    makes logical sense for the background-color and border-color properties to be defined in this
                    module. And you'd be right.</p>

            </section>

            <section class="theme-section" id="CSS_Specifications">
                <h2>CSS Specifications</h2>

                <p>All web standards technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) are defined in giant documents called
                    specifications (or "specs"), which are published by standards organizations (such as the W3C,
                    WHATWG, ECMA, or Khronos) and define precisely how those technologies are supposed to behave.</p>

                <p>CSS is no different — it is developed by a group within the W3C called the CSS Working Group. This
                    group is made of representatives of browser vendors and other companies who have an interest in CSS.
                    There are also other people, known as invited experts, who act as independent voices; they are not
                    linked to a member organization.</p>

                <p>New CSS features are developed, or specified, by the CSS Working Group. Sometimes because a
                    particular browser is interested in having some capability, other times because web designers and
                    developers are asking for a feature, and sometimes because the Working Group itself has identified a
                    requirement. CSS is constantly developing, with new features coming available. However, a key thing
                    about CSS is that everyone works very hard to never change things in a way that would break old
                    websites. A website built in 2000, using the limited CSS available then, should still be usable in a
                    browser today!</p>

                <p>As a newcomer to CSS, it is likely that you will find the CSS specs overwhelming — they are intended
                    for engineers to use to implement support for the features in user agents, not for web developers to
                    read to understand CSS. Many experienced developers would much rather refer to MDN documentation or
                    other tutorials. It is however worth knowing that they exist, understanding the relationship between
                    the CSS you are using, browser support (see below), and the specs.</p>

                <h2>Browser support information</h2>

                <p>Once CSS has been specified then it is only useful for us in developing web pages if one or more
                    browsers have implemented it. This means that the code has been written to turn the instruction in
                    our CSS file into something that can be output to the screen. We'll look at this process more in the
                    lesson How CSS works. It is unusual for all browsers to implement a feature at the same time, and so
                    there is usually a gap where you can use some part of CSS in some browsers and not in others. For
                    this reason, being able to check implementation status is useful.</p>

                <p>The browser support status is shown on every MDN property page in a section named "Browser
                    compatibility" (use this to check if the property can be used on your website). For example, the
                    compatibility section for the CSS font-family property is reproduced below.</p>

                <h2>Adding CSS to our document</h2>

                <p>The very first thing we need to do is to tell the HTML document that we have some CSS rules we want
                    it to use. There are three different ways to apply CSS to an HTML document that you'll commonly come
                    across, however, for now, we will look at the most usual and useful way of doing so — linking CSS
                    from the head of your document.</p>

                <p>Create a file in the same folder as your HTML document and save it as styles.css. The .css extension
                    shows that this is a CSS file.</p>

                <p>To link styles.css to index.html add the following line somewhere inside the &lt;head&gt; of the HTML
                    document:</p>

                <div class="code-container">
                    <code>
                        &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&gt;
                    </code>
                </div>

                <p>This &lt;link&gt; element tells the browser that we have a stylesheet, using the rel attribute, and
                    the location of that stylesheet as the value of the href attribute. You can test that the CSS works
                    by adding a rule to styles.css. Using your code editor add the following to your CSS file:</p>

                <div class="code-container">
                    <code>
                        h1 {
                        color: red;
                        }
                    </code>

                <p>Save your HTML and CSS files and reload the page in a web browser. The level one heading at the top
                    of the document should now be red. If that happens, congratulations — you have successfully applied
                    some CSS to an HTML document. If that doesn't happen, carefully check that you've typed everything
                    correctly.</p>

                <p>You can continue to work in styles.css locally, or you can use our interactive editor below to
                    continue with this tutorial. The interactive editor acts as if the CSS in the first panel is linked
                    to the HTML document, just as we have with our document above.</p>

                <h2>Styling HTML elements</h2>

                <p>By making our heading red we have already demonstrated that we can target and style an HTML element.
                    We do this by targeting an element selector — this is a selector that directly matches an HTML
                    element name. To target all paragraphs in the document you would use the selector p. To turn all
                    paragraphs green you would use:</p>

                <div class="code-container">
                    <code>
                        p {
                        color: green;
                        }
                    </code>
                </div>

                <p>You can target multiple selectors at once, by separating the selectors with a comma. If I want all
                    paragraphs and all list items to be green my rule looks like this:</p>

                <div class="code-container">
                    <code>
                        p, li {
                        color: green;
                        }
                    </code>
                </div>

                <p>Try this out in the interactive editor below (edit the code boxes), or in your local CSS document.

            <section class="theme-section" id="Changing_the_default_behavior_of_elements">
                <h2>Changing the default behavior of elements</h2>

                <p>When we look at a well-marked up HTML document, even something as simple as our example, we can see
                    how the browser is making the HTML readable by adding some default styling. Headings are large and
                    bold and our list has bullets. This happens because browsers have internal stylesheets containing
                    default styles, which they apply to all pages by default; without them all of the text would run
                    together in a clump and we would have to style everything from scratch. All modern browsers display
                    HTML content by default in pretty much the same way.</p>

                <p>However, you will often want something other than the choice the browser has made. This can be done
                    by choosing the HTML element that you want to change, and using a CSS rule to change the way it
                    looks. A good example is our &lt;ul&gt;, an unordered list. It has list bullets, and if I decide I
                    don't want those bullets I can remove them like so:</p>

                <div class="code-container">
                    <code>
                        li {
                        list-style-type: none;
                        }
                    </code>
                </div>

                <p>Try adding this to your CSS now.</p>

                <p>The list-style-type property is a good property to look at on MDN to see which values are supported.
                    Take a look at the page for list-style-type and you will find an interactive example at the top of
                    the page to try some different values in, then all allowable values are detailed further down the
                    page.</p>

                <p>Looking at that page you will discover that in addition to removing the list bullets you can change
                    them — try changing them to square bullets by using a value of square.</p>

            <section class="theme-section" id="Adding_a_class">
                <h2>Adding a class</h2>

                <p>So far we have styled elements based on their HTML element names. This works as long as you want all
                    of the elements of that type in your document to look the same. Most of the time that isn't the case
                    and so you will need to find a way to select a subset of the elements without changing the others.
                    The most common way to do this is to add a class to your HTML element and target that class.</p>

                <p>In your HTML document, add a class attribute to the second list item. Your list will now look like
                    this:</p>

                <div class="code-container">
                    <code>
                        &lt;ul&gt;<br>
                        &lt;li&gt;Item one&lt;/li&gt;<br>
                        &lt;li class="special"&gt;Item two&lt;/li&gt;<br>
                        &lt;li&gt;Item &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>
                        &lt;/ul&gt;
                    </code>
                </div>

                <p>In your CSS you can target the class of special by creating a selector that starts with a full stop
                    character. Add the following to your CSS file:</p>

                <div class="code-container">
                    <code>
                        .special {<br>
                        color: orange;<br>
                        font-weight: bold;<br>
                        }
                    </code>
                </div>

                <p>Save and refresh to see what the result is.</p>

                <p>You can apply the class of special to any element on your page that you want to have the same look as
                    this list item. For example, you might want the &lt;span&gt; in the paragraph to also be orange and
                    bold. Try adding a class of special to it, then reload your page and see what happens.</p>

                <p>Sometimes you will see rules with a selector that lists the HTML element selector along with the
                    class:</p>

                <div class="code-container">
                    <code>
                        li.special {<br>
                        color: orange;<br>
                        font-weight: bold;<br>
                        }
                    </code>
                </div>

                <p>This syntax means "target any li element that has a class of special". If you were to do this then
                    you
                    would no longer be able to apply the class to a &lt;span&gt; or another element by adding the class
                    to
                    it; you would have to add that element to the list of selectors:</p>

                <div class="code-container">
                    <code>
                        li.special,<br>
                        span.special {<br>
                        color: orange;<br>
                        font-weight: bold;<br>
                        }
                    </code>
                </div>

                <p>As you can imagine, some classes might be applied to many elements and you don't want to have to keep
                    editing your CSS every time something new needs to take on that style. Therefore it is sometimes
                    best to
                    bypass the element and refer to the class, unless you know that you want to create some special
                    rules
                    for one element alone, and perhaps want to make sure they are not applied to other things.</p>

                <h2>Styling things based on their location in a document</h2>

                <p>There are times when you will want something to look different based on where it is in the document.
                    There are a number of selectors that can help you here, but for now we will look at just a couple.
                    In our document are two &lt;em&gt; elements — one inside a paragraph and the other inside a list
                    item. To select only an &lt;em&gt; that is nested inside an &lt;li&gt; element I can use a selector
                    called the descendant combinator, which takes the form of a space between two other selectors.</p>

                <p>Add the following rule to your stylesheet.</p>

                <div class="code-container">
                    <code>
                        li em {
                        color: rebeccapurple;
                        }
                    </code>
                </div>

                <p>This selector will select any &lt;em&gt; element that is inside (a descendant of) an &lt;li&gt;. So
                    in
                    your example document, you should find that the &lt;em&gt; in the third list item is now purple, but
                    the
                    one inside the paragraph is unchanged.</p>

                <p>Something else you might like to try is styling a paragraph when it comes directly after a heading at
                    the
                    same hierarchy level in the HTML. To do so place a + (an adjacent sibling combinator) between the
                    selectors.</p>

                <p>Try adding this rule to your stylesheet as well:</p>

                <div class="code-container">
                    <code>
                        h1 + p {
                        font-size: 200%;
                        }
                    </code>
                </div>

                <p>The live example below includes the two rules above. Try adding a rule to make a span red, if it is
                    inside a paragraph. You will know if you have it right as the span in the first paragraph will be
                    red,
                    but the one in the first list item will not change color.</p>


                <div class="note">
                    <span class="note__header">Note:</span> As you can see, CSS gives us several ways to target elements, and we've only
                    scratched the surface
                    so far! We will be taking a proper look at all of these selectors and many more in our Selectors

                <h2>Styling things based on state</h2>

                <p>The final type of styling we shall take a look at in this tutorial is the ability to style things
                    based
                    on their state. A straightforward example of this is when styling links. When we style a link we
                    need to
                    target the &lt;a&gt; (anchor) element. This has different states depending on whether it is
                    unvisited,
                    visited, being hovered over, focused via the keyboard, or in the process of being clicked
                    (activated).
                    You can use CSS to target these different states — the CSS below styles unvisited links pink and
                    visited
                    links green.</p>

                <div class="code-container">
                    <code>
                        a:link {
                        color: pink;
                        }
                        <br>
                        a:visited {
                        color: green;
                        }
                    </code>
                </div>

                <p>You can change the way the link looks when the user hovers over it, for example removing the
                    underline,
                    which is achieved by in the next rule:</p>

                <div class="code-container">
                    <code>
                        a:hover {
                        text-decoration: none;
                        }
                    </code>
                </div>

                <p>In the live example below, you can play with different values for the various states of a link. I
                    have
                    added the rules above to it, and now realize that the pink color is quite light and hard to read —
                    why
                    not change that to a better color? Can you make the links bold?</p>

                <p>We have removed the underline on our link on hover. You could remove the underline from all states of
                    a
                    link. It is worth remembering however that in a real site, you want to ensure that visitors know
                    that a
                    link is a link. Leaving the underline in place, can be an important clue for people to realize that
                    some
                    text inside a paragraph can be clicked on — this is the behavior they are used to. As with
                    everything in
                    CSS, there is the potential to make the document less accessible with your changes — we will aim to
                    highlight potential pitfalls in appropriate places.</p>

                <div class="note">
                    <span class="note__header">Note:</span> you will often see mention of accessibility in these lessons and across MDN. When
                    we talk about
                    accessibility we are referring to the requirement for our webpages to be understandable and usable
                    by
                    everyone.
                </div>

                <p>Your visitor may well be on a computer with a mouse or trackpad, or a phone with a touchscreen. Or
                    they
                    might be using a screenreader, which reads out the content of the document, or they may need to use
                    much
                    larger text, or be navigating the site using the keyboard only.</p>

                <p>A plain HTML document is generally accessible to everyone — as you start to style that document it is
                    important that you don't make it less accessible.</p>

                <p>It is worth noting that you can combine multiple selectors and combinators together. For example:</p>

                <div class="code-container">

                <p>You can combine multiple types together, too. Try adding the following into your code:</p>

                <p>This will style any element with a class of special, which is inside a &lt;p&gt;, which comes just
                    after
                    an &lt;h1&gt;, which is inside a &lt;body&gt;. Phew!</p>

                <p>In the original HTML we provided, the only element styled is &lt;span class="special"&gt;.</p>

                <p>Don't worry if this seems complicated at the moment — you'll soon start to get the hang of it as you
                    write more CSS.</p>

                <p>In this tutorial, we have taken a look at a number of ways in which you can style a document using
                    CSS.
                    We will be developing this knowledge as we move through the rest of the lessons. However you now
                    already
                    know enough to style text, apply CSS based on different ways of targeting elements in the document,
                    and
                    look up properties and values in the MDN documentation.</p>
